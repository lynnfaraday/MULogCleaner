<h1>Faraday's RP Log Cleaner</h1>

The log cleaner takes raw log files (presumably captured by your favorite MU* client) and strips out junk such as pages, channels, OOC chatter, coming/going messages, and various other soft- and hard-coded command spam.  It also adds blank lines as necessary so everything is spaced out nicely.

<p>You can choose a log format, which tells the parser what things to keep and to ignore.  Available formats are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>MUSH</strong> - Excludes MUSH-style channels. &lt;Public&gt; Faraday says, "Hello."  Covers PennMUSH and AresMUSH.
    <li><strong>MUX</strong> - Excludes MUX-style channels. [Public] Faraday says, "Hello."
    <li><strong>FS3 Combat</strong> - Handles logs with FS3 skill or combat messages, omitting spam while keeping important combat messages.
    <li><strong>FS3 Combat Wiki</strong> - Same as <i>FS3 Combat</i>, but also adds pretty wikidot formatting.
    <li><strong>TGG Battle </strong>- Handles battle logs from The Greatest Generation MUX, omitting spam while keeping important combat messages.
    <li><strong>TGG Battle Wiki</strong> - Same as <i>TG Battle</i>, but also adds pretty wikidot formatting.
</ul>
